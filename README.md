# Regression-Project-Concordia
This project is part of the Bootcamp in DataScience. It  explores rental price prediction using machine learning. We analyze a dataset of rental listings across Canada in 2024 and build a Random Forest Regression model to estimate rental prices based on key features like bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location.
